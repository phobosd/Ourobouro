  "description": "A grizzled street doc with chrome eyes and a network of scars crisscrossing his face, Chrome-Jack wears patched leather gloves over thick cybernetic fingers. His clothes are worn but clean, the kind you might find hanging in a high-end haberdashery if they hadn't been scavenged from corporate waste bins. He has a weary look about him, and speaks with quiet authority.",
